# Tips From Starfleet Training Manual:
## STARTING OUT

At the beginning of a mission, the mission clock will not start until you actually start your engines. So, its worth taking the time to examine the region you are in to locate class F or G star systems, black holes, and other starforts. Set your first target to a suitable class F‘ or G system, preferably in a cluster of systems to give you a good probe spread.

Speaking of probes, in missions that the time allowed is the main enemy, it is important to get probes working for you as early as possible. Here's a trick which helps. When docked at a starfort, send out probes to all systems within range before you start moving. If you are docked during
the course of a mission, the probes will be replaced automatically, but at the start of the mission you will have to do this yourself (using Material Transfer). Strictly, this is stealing more than your fair share, but who’s going to complain? This way, you could command up to 10 probes before resupply, though only five can be in use at any one time. Get into the habit of regular detonation of those probes which are passive (though make a note of those reporting enemy activity). Also, try to send probes to the star systems which are more likely to have 'useful' planets (class F and G) rather than just scattering them around.

You can also use Personnel Transfer to allocate yourself more crew and shock troops. But remember that with more personnel on board, supplies are consumed more rapidly and will be depleted earlier than usual.

Since the first few star systems you visit will probably be unknown before you arrive, set your second target near the edge of the System Map.

Then, if there is nothing in the system worth exploring, it takes only a short time to leave. Also, if you arrive in the system and the only planet is on the other side of the System Map, it’s quicker'to jump to a nearby star system and target the planet from there, rather than navigating
across the system at 0.9.

## PROBE REPORTS

‘Enemy activity’ can mean a number of things — an enemy ship in the system, enemy on a planet, or an enemy starbase. If you get an 'enemy activity’ report, form a theory and test it. If the system has no planets, that cuts out the second possibility and makes a starbase probable (frustrated players of mission 1D please note).

But it may not he a starbase. It may be a UGA trick which has frustrated many players. It works like this. You get a report of enemy activity from a probe, race to the system and explore it, only to find nothing there. You call up the probes control and find that enemy activity is still reported.  Either the enemy ship is deliberately keeping its distance (your LRS only scans 20x20 whereas a System Map covers an area 80x80) or there is something strange going on. Players above the rank of Altern can put their escorts in system search, but what if the search reveals nothing yetthe probe still reports enemy activity?

The answer is to go to the corners of the star system, so that your LRS actually covers an area outside the System Map. Sometimes enemy ships, especially scouts, lurk there. Don’t forget, you can move beyOnd the edge of a star system - and if you can, so can the UGA! Scouts are the easiest enemy ships to kill (though you rarely actually catch sight of them), but you must decide whether it is worth your time to explore these remote areas. If you are after larger prey, it probably isn’t.

The ability of probes to give information about enemy ship movements makes them useful even in long missions, after most or all systems have been mapped. Note that a probe will report an enemy ship entering a system, but not one leaving it (the same as an established base). A probe can’t provide as much information as a base, but can be used in systems where you can’t send a landing party, such as a system containing no planets or only a class G planet which you suspect also has a starbase.

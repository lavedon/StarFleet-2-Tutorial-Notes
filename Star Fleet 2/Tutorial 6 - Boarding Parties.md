# Tutorial #6: Boarding Parties

### When to use: Prior to mission 2-A.

## Starting Out
1. You are in orbit around planet SS-46B.
2. An enemy freighter is also in orbit with you.
3. The simulation is currently paused

## Enemy Surrender
1. Press [I] for Science Control and then [S] for Scanners.
2. Use the TDB to designate the enemy freighter for a scan.
	+ Note: The scan reveals the freighter is already quite low on energy.
	+ Its shields are still up
	+ **You can NEVER board a ship with raised shields.
3. Two choices for capturing the freighter:
	+ Shoot at the freighter until his shields are down.
		+ Shooting may accidentally destroy the ship.
	+ Bully the freighter into lowering his shields.
4. Press [ALT][M] to return to the Main Menu
5. Press [M]/[S]/[E] to send a message to the enemy ship.
6. Select the freighter using the Target Designator Box (TDB) that appears.
7. This brings up the Message Transmission box on the right of your screen.
8. The default selection, Demand Surrender, is already highlighted.
9. Press [ENTER] to send the mssage.
10. You will receive a surrender response from the freighter.

## Boarding

1. Return to the Main Menu and press [E] / [T] / [B] to select the Boarding Party option in the Teleporters menu.

2. You are told that there are 150 shock troops ready.

3. You need to specify what your troops should do to the enemy personnel.

	+ Select capture.
4. Kill works well when you have a limited number of troops.

5. A profile of the ship now appears.

6. The shaded areas represent critical systems on the ship.
    + Critical systems have their own internal shielding.

7. Use the cursor keys to move the cursor to a point just to the left of the bridge.
   + See the freighter diagram on page 123 of the Battle Manual.
   + The bridge occupies the topmost deck.
   + Press [SPACE] to select the bridge.
   + A boarding team icon will now appear on the selected bridge.
8. Using the cursor and [Space] bar, select 4 other sites.
9. Press [A] to activate the teleporters.
10. Since the ship has already surrendered, there will be no battle.
11. The entire freighter will turn green to indicate your successful capture.
12. You will receive a message telling you how many prisoners have been taken.
13. Press [ESC] to return to the Main Display.

#### Recall the Boarding Party
1. You will be asked whether you want to recall the Boarding Party -
	+ Press [Y] 
2. Do not leave a team of guards, press [N] to when asked.
	+ Prize crews will be covered later.
3. In the Orbital Display, the freighter is now green.
	+ The red alert is now cancelled.

## 3 Options: What to do with a captured ship.
1. Leave the ship  in orbit.
2. Return the ship to starfort.
3. Leave a prize crew, and operator the ship as part of your squadron.

## 1. Leave ship in orbit
   1. Does not offer a benefit
   2. Ship will be recaptured by the UGA at some point.
## 2. Return the ship to starfort
   1. Use the Personnel Transfer option to teleport a prize crew.
   	+ At least 10 shock troops
	+ 20 crewmen.
   2. The prize crew will repair the captured ship and deliver it to starfort.
   	+ NOTE: If you leave a team of guards when returning from the capture, you need only transport 20 crewmen over later, since 10 shock troops will already be there.
	+ NOTE: Captured enemy freighters usually have enough energy to make the journey to a starfot unaided - No matter how much damage they sustain
	+ Other enemy ships - besides freighters - may need additional energy.
		+ If you need to send additional energy to your captured ships, use the **Material Transfer** option to teleport energy to them.
		+ If a captured ship does not reach starfort, it is because you forgot to transfer over energy.
	+ It is recommended to make sure captured ships have **200 - 300** nits of power for the journey to starfort.
## 3. Prize Crew 

1. Used to free up your ship for other endeavors.
	
2. Takes some time for the prize ship to be delivered 
	
3. Depletes your crew.
# We will tow the captured freighter to Starfort.
+ To tow, we use the tractor beam.

1. Before you lock onto the freighter, with your tractor beam, you must get close.
	+ Get close by adjusting your orbital altitude.
	+ Press [SHIFT] with the up and down arrow keys.
		+ This changes your orbit and allows you to move adjacent to the freighter.
		+ This manuever can sometimes be difficult.
	+ Make sure the grid is on.
		+ Press [ALT][G]
	+ The grid will show the orbital position. 
2. When you are next to the freighter, either in the same or an adjacent orbit, go to Engineering and press [B] for Tractor Beam.

3. Move the TDB over the captured ship and press [ENTER].

4. If you are close enough to the captured ship, you will receive a report confirming lock-on.
	+ If lock on is not confirmed, keep manuevering your ship until lock on is achieved.

5. Now, with the enemy in tow, return to a starfort and dock. 

# NOTE: If you raise your shields, at any point, the tractor beam will immediately be disconnected.
+ You can disable automoatic shields raising by changing Auto Shields to manual 
		+ press [ALT][A]

### NOTE: If you sent the ship back to starfort via a prize crew, you will receive a message when it arrives.

Your hyperspace speed is the total of the speeds you have set on the "H" and 
"S" scales of the velocity indicator (2.0). For example, to set a hyperspace 
speed of 3.5, set the "H" scale to 3.0 and the "S" scale to 0.5. When you come 
out of hyperspace upon reaching your destination, the reading on the "H" scale 
(current hyperspace speed) will drop to zero, and your ship will continue 
moving at maximum sub light speed (normally 0.9) until you reach the target.

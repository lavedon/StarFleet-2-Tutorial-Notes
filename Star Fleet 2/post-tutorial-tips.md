# Tips From Starfleet Training Manual:
## STARTING OUT

At the beginning of a mission, the mission clock will not start until you actually start your engines. So, its worth taking the time to examine the region you are in to locate class F or G star systems, black holes, and other starforts. Set your first target to a suitable class F or G system, preferably in a cluster of systems to give you a good probe spread.

Speaking of probes, in missions that the time allowed is the main enemy, it is important to get probes working for you as early as possible. Here's a trick which helps. When docked at a starfort, send out probes to all systems within range before you start moving. If you are docked during
the course of a mission, the probes will be replaced automatically, but at the start of the mission you will have to do this yourself (using Material Transfer). Strictly, this is stealing more than your fair share, but who’s going to complain? This way, you could command up to 10 probes before resupply, though only five can be in use at any one time. Get into the habit of regular detonation of those probes which are passive (though make a note of those reporting enemy activity). Also, try to send probes to the star systems which are more likely to have 'useful' planets (class F and G) rather than just scattering them around.

You can also use Personnel Transfer to allocate yourself more crew and shock troops. But remember that with more personnel on board, supplies are consumed more rapidly and will be depleted earlier than usual.

Since the first few star systems you visit will probably be unknown before you arrive, set your second target near the edge of the System Map.

Then, if there is nothing in the system worth exploring, it takes only a short time to leave. Also, if you arrive in the system and the only planet is on the other side of the System Map, it’s quicker to jump to a nearby star system and target the planet from there, rather than navigating
across the system at 0.9.

## PROBE REPORTS

‘Enemy activity’ can mean a number of things — an enemy ship in the system, enemy on a planet, or an enemy starbase. If you get an 'enemy activity’ report, form a theory and test it. If the system has no planets, that cuts out the second possibility and makes a starbase probable (frustrated players of mission 1D please note).

But it may not he a starbase. It may be a UGA trick which has frustrated many players. It works like this. You get a report of enemy activity from a probe, race to the system and explore it, only to find nothing there. You call up the probes control and find that enemy activity is still reported.  Either the enemy ship is deliberately keeping its distance (your LRS only scans 20x20 whereas a System Map covers an area 80x80) or there is something strange going on. Players above the rank of Altern can put their escorts in system search, but what if the search reveals nothing yet the probe still reports enemy activity?

The answer is to go to the corners of the star system, so that your LRS actually covers an area outside the System Map. Sometimes enemy ships, especially scouts, lurk there. Don’t forget, you can move beyond the edge of a star system - and if you can, so can the UGA! Scouts are the easiest enemy ships to kill (though you rarely actually catch sight of them), but you must decide whether it is worth your time to explore these remote areas. If you are after larger prey, it probably isn’t.

The ability of probes to give information about enemy ship movements makes them useful even in long missions, after most or all systems have been mapped. Note that a probe will report an enemy ship entering a system, but not one leaving it (the same as an established base). A probe can’t provide as much information as a base, but can be used in systems where you can’t send a landing party, such as a system containing no planets or only a class G planet which you suspect also has a starbase.

## ENEMY SHIPS — MOVEMENT AND LOCATION

Many commanders faced with the task of capturing or killing a light or heavy cruiser have spent days searching systems without even seeing a cruiser, let alone engaging one. Here are a few hints.

Planetary bases and starforts are the most common sources of information. Most of you have received the messages “Enemy ship arrived in our system” and "Enemy ship has just entered orbit” from an established planetary base. The ship is usually a freighter or starliner.  What if you receive the first message, but it’s not followed by the second?
Has the enemy ship left the system, gone to another planet in the same system, or to a starbase in a part of the system you haven’t explored?  (This can help you locate starbases.) If the system contains only one planet, there is a good chance there is a starbase there.

Occasionally a starfort will send the "Enemy ship arrived in our system” message. If you are cruiser-hunting, go there quickly! The enemy is nearly always a warship, and is often a cruiser.

Enemy warships often hang around, or in, starbases. If you are adept at destroying starbases (which also destroys any ships docked at the time), then go for it. But if you need to capture an enemy ship, rather than kill it, there are a few tricks which sometimes lure them out.

The first one is the familiar tactic for destroying a base and keeping reasonably safe. Steer towards it with escorts in a suitable formation (#6 is popular), and as soon as you get in range fire off a salvo of torpedoes (the more daring will send two or three salvos before turning). Then
execute a 180° turn and get out of the enemy’s range. After a short time do another about-face and repeat the tactic as many times as you can get away with it. This is not only a good tactic for defeating a starbase, but it also stands a very good chance of luring out any warships docked at it.

Of course, the first time you get within range of a starbase, have a look at the Target Data Display. If you are warship-hunting and there is only one target (the starbase itself) then you have made an unfortunate choice, but you might as well wipe out the starbase anyway.

The second trick works only if there is an enemy planet in the same system as a starbase (it may also work if the enemy planet is in a system close to a system with a starbase). Simply orbit the planet (with escorts) and bombard it. Often enemy ships will emerge from the starbase and
race to the planet to try to stop you. But be careful when going into orbit in the first place, since your ship may enter orbit with shields down. If an enemy cruiser is already lurking in orbit waiting for you, that could well be the end of that mission.

## PLANET EXPLORATION AND BOMBARDMENT
There are several Opinions about the number of landing party teams one should use. A common, but by no means universal, formula is this:


|Tech Level | Number of Teams |
| --- | --- |
| Tech 1 - 3: | 1 Survey, 1 Base (with Supplies, if-necessary) |
| Tech 4 - 5: | 4 Survey, 5 Base (Supplies) |
| Tech 6 - 7: | You won’t be “able to send landing parties until any planetary shields have been knocked out. |


What counts in most cases is not the length of time it takes to complete a survey or establish a base, but how long your ship spends in orbit organizing these things. You can set up all landing party activities in freeze (and all other teleporter functions as well), so get used to saving
time that way.

Those who want to establish bases quickly, so that they can become information sources, should send more than one team even to low-tech planets. Don’t forget, particularly in harder missions, that bases can be used almost as starforts in that they can carry stores of torpedoes, supplies, probes, and personnel. But they cannot repair hull damage.

There are conflicting Opinions, too, about whether you should bring personnel back to your ship when they have finished their mission on a planet. Although you get more crew and troops to use elsewhere, they could bring back nasty diseases. And you remove all personnel from an established base, local enemy or natives could destroy the base. It comes down to time. If you are short of time to complete a mission, diverting to planets to pick up personnel is not a good idea. If you have plenty of trime and don’t mind a lot of diversions, perhaps the trips are worthwhile.

Bombarding a planet is necessary on many occasions. For example, mission 30 requires you to force the surrender of a number of planets, which means bombard them until they surrender. Bombarding from orbit allows you to use your escorts to help you, but experience shows that if UGA forces are on a planet they will often let you reduce the planet to a barren waste rather than surrender. In Orbit Control you can target specific cities, rather than shooting blind from orbit, and this may be more effective if an invasion is planned.

Beware of a trick the UGA sometimes pulls on you. While you are bombarding a planet, you may get a message telling you that the planet’s inhabitants are surrendering and are waiting for your negotiating teams to arrive. Gleefully, you cease fire, send down some landing party teams, and are just about to move away when the planet puts up shields and your landing party gets beaten up. You cannot beam up your landing party without first taking out the planetary shields, which may have more than 20,000 units of power, and by then you may have already used most of your weapons on the original bombardment. A dirty trick - but wouldn’t the Krellans pull something like that, given the chance?

If you conduct a bombardment as a prelude to invasion, be careful not to overdo it. When you have reduced the shields to zero, freeze, and look at the Invasions data or planetary bombardment table to check how many of the original cities have been destroyed. In order to conduct a regular
invasion, you need to leave at least some cities intact to act as your invasion zones, so make sure the bombardment is halted before all are destroyed. If you don’t, and bombard all the cities to destruction, your forthcoming invasion will be easy (as soon as you enter the Invasions option, the planet immediately surrenders), but unfortunately Krellan Headquarters doesn’t count that as a proper capture and you lose Krels for each city destroyed. On the mission tally it will acknowledge such a ‘cheap’ capture, but in Orders it will not. This may explain the frustration some players have experienced when they believe they have met the mission criteria but the program hasn't acknowledged their success. (31)

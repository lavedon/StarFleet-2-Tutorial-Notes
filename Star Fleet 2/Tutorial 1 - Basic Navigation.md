# Tutorial 1 - Basic Navigation
Note: which keyboard layout you are using
![](./Images/Pasted%20image%2020201217144744.png)

This tutorial assumes you are using Keyboard layout B (A style function keys are quite rare these days I think)
1. Your ship starts out docked at starfort 
	a. Your ship position is 8,77 the same as the fort
	b. All scanners show the starfort 
				![](./Images/Pasted%20image%2020201203223334.png)
		i. Both the tactical display
			![[Pasted image 20201204093352.png]]
		ii. and Long Range Scanners

## System Navigation - Automatic
1. Press [N] for Navigation Control
2. Then [S] to display the System Map
3. You can now see the rest of the system
 ![[Pasted image 20201204093341.png]]
4. The planet information box, top right, tells you this is planet A in star system 3

### Go to the planet
1. Use the arrow keys to move the Target Designator Box (TDB) until the box is over the planet
![[sf2-t1-1.gif]]
2. [SHIFT] will move the Target Designator Box (TDB) in larger increments
3. Note: the object in the TARGET information area, bottom left, is now "Planet"
![[Pasted image 20201204095549.png]]
4. Once the Target Designator Box (TDB) is over the planet press [T].  [T] brings up the Targeter
## Set Speed
1. You can not go faster than light within a system
	a. Meaning within a system your max speed is 0.9
2. use [F3] and [F4] to change your sublight speed

4. Set your sublight speed to 0.5

 5. Press [ENTER] to accept speed
 6. 5. Press [ESC] to return to the main display
 7.  8. Press [F9] to start your engines
 8.  ![sf2-t1-2](sf2-t1-2.gif)

 9. 
 10. Ship will auto-rotate to the required heading
 11. You will automatically undock - and move away from starfort

 13. The NAV information, between the two displays, confirms your target as SS-3A
	 1. and indicates a course heading in degrees

## Tactical Display
1. Your ship symbol is always in the center of the tactical display
![](Pasted%20image%2020201217105634.png)
2. Except, when you are docked in starfort, the starfort symbol is in the center of the display
![](Pasted%20image%2020201217105910.png)
4. The tactical display will show objects within five points
	1. i.e. the starfort will dissapear from the display when you are more than five points away from it
5. The Long Range Scanner (LRS) displays shows objects within 20 points
6. You will soon see the sun and planet in your Long Range Scanner (LRS) display
![](Pasted%20image%2020201217143103.png)
7. When you reach your destination, you will be asked if you want to establish orbit.
![](Pasted%20image%2020201217143322.png)
	1. Press [N] to decline. We will cover orbitting later

	
# Manual System Navigation
1. Manual navigation is not normally a good way to travel inside a system.
	* Manual navigation is a useful technique when you are chasing or avoiding an enemy.
	* Or if you need to steer cautiously around a starbase.
2. Let's navigate back to starfort manually.
	* Set sublight speed to 0.3 using [F3] and [F4]
	* Start your engines [F9]
	* Go streight to the System Map [Alt][S] and see what happens.
	* You are probably going the wrong way:
		1. Use [F5] and [F6] to steer your ship on course
		2. Use [SHIFT] with [F5] and [F6] (rudder keys) to steer the ship in larger increments
			* 15 degrees at a time vs 1 degree at a time
3. Try to get a good course to the starfort
	* Probably at 310 degrees.
	* If things are going to fast - press [ALT][F] to pause and unpause the game.
	
4. When the starbase is about 10 points away 
	* Within the green sqaure on your screen.
	* The square shows the extent of your LRS scan.
5. Switch to the Main Display [ALT][M]
	* Check in in your LRS that the starfots is directly ahead of you - if it isn't alter course.
	* When it appears on TAC, it should 'come down' the centerline straight at you.
6. Slow down your engines [F4]([F3])
	* Come to a halt next to the starfort.
	
## Dock Manually
1. Go to the Helm portion of Nav Control, so press [N] / [H] / [D] and you are docked.

## Manual Navigation is difficult with Target `#1` loaded
1. Problem: The computer switches between the computer and the helm - while you are trying to navigate.
2. Use the Manual Helm Override switch [Alt][H] which will
	* Temporarily disengage the set navigation target
	* Allow you to use manual navigation
3. Hit [Alt][H] again to resume movement to the target
4. When helm override is active [Alt][H] the target in the NAV area turns white and flashes.
5. Swap and delete targets with the Targets command ([N]/[S]/[R]).
	1. Hint: When you Delete or Swap targets in the Targeter, press [ENTER] not [Esc], to exit the Targeter - or it will forget your changes.

# Navigation Between Star Systems
1. You can not manually navigate between star systems
	1. You must use the Targeter
	2. You navigate to another star system just as you would use the Targeter to navigate to a destination within a star system
	3. You will automatically navigate to the edge of the solar system - before entering hyperspace
2. Note: Any errors in interstellar navigation (such as the ship waiting at the edge of the solar system) delete all targets and reset them with:
	1. The target solar system as the first target.
3. Note: In order to enter hyperspace, your ship must:
	1. Have reached the edge of a star system
	2. Have a velocity of 0.9 before it can jump into hyperspace
## Navigate to SS-33 at 28,3
1.	Open the Navigation Map [ALT][N]
2.	You can explore a system without visiting it, by using a sensor probe.
3.	Move the TDB over the white star directly above your location - at 29,2
	1.	Will be covered by the TDB until you press [up arrow]
	2.	Press [P] to target a probe to that system.
	3.	The Probes Display appears, with Probe #1 targeted as instructed.
	4.	Press [ENTER] to launch the probe.
	5.	Note in the lower left corner of the screen that the targeted system is SS-45, class O.
4. Use the TDB again to target the light blue system SS-33 at 28, 3.
5. Press [T] to bring up the Targeter
6. Since this is a hyperspace journey, you need to set a speed of 1.0 or greater.
7. We are going to select the maximum safe speed (8.0)
	1. Press [SHIFT][F1]/[F3]/[F3] ([Shift][F2/[F1] / [F1]), and enter the target ([ENTER]).
8. A System Map of the target system then appears, allowing you to set a second target within the system.
9. Set this by moving the TDB to the play you want to target and press [ENTER].
10. In this case, we don't know what is in the system except for the star in the center, so let's set the TDB near the system edge, and press [ENTER]
11. Start your engines [F9]
## The three stages of a hyperspace journey
1. The ship navigates from your current location, to the system edge at a speed of 0.9
	1. When the ship reaches the end of the system -- you jump into hyperspace
2. You travel at your hyperspace speed (in our case 8.0) between systems 
	1. When you reach your target system, you are told that target #1 has been reached and target #2 loaded.
3. There is a short trip within the new system to the final target, at speed 0.9.
#### Note: Your navigation computer will only put you within 5 points of your target in the new system
1. You will likely have to navigate further
## Planets in the system
1. Note: The Nav Map now shows the stary symbol as a 'o' with one dor over it.
	1. This dot represents a planet.  There is one dot because one planet orbits the star in this system.
2. Go to the system map [ALT][S]
3. Target the planet and start traveling there.
4. Exit to the Main Display
5. Note: At some point you will receive a message from Probe #1 - telling you it has completed its mission.
# ORBITING A PLANET
1. When you reach the planet, answer [Y] at the "Establish orbit?" prompt, and the Tactical Display will be replace by the Orbital Display.
2. You now see a close up of the planet.
	1. Your tactical display has been replaced with an orbital display (since you are indeed orbitting the planet)
	
![](Pasted%20image%2020201217143412.png)

3. Since this is the first time the planet has been examined closely, your scanners will automatically activate.
	1.  Scanned information is now entered into your Database.
4.  When asked, "Display planetary map?", press [N]
# Return to Starfort
1. Call up the War Map [ALT][W]
	1. Note: Starforts are only visible on the War Map and not the Nav Map
2. Target the nearest starfort.
3. Set a speed of 1.0 or greater.
4. When the System Map is displayed, move the TDB to the starfort symbol and press [ENTER]
5. Start your engines.
6. When you arrive, you will receive the "Shall we dock?" prompt.
7. Press [Y].
# Leaving the Tutorial
1. From the Main Display 
	1. Press [C] for computer
	2. [S] for Special Services
	3. [Q] to Quit.
2. Press [Y] to confirm that you want to quit.

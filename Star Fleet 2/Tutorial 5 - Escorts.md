	3. To deselect an escort (that is, an escort which is already selected) press [-]

### Set tasks

1. Set the Escorts to:
	+ Escort #1 to Disable
	+ Escort #2 to Slave to Us
		+ First deselect Escort #1 
	+ Escort #3 to Exclusive Fire
	+ Escort #4 to Hold Fire

| Escort | Effect |
| :--: | :--: |
 | Escort #1 | Will try to disable, rather than destroy, its target.
 | Escort #2 |  Will fire at anything your ship fires at. |
 | Escort #3 | Will fire at any target your ship does **NOT** fire at. |
 | Escort #4 | Will not fire at all. |
 
1. If you made these settings correctly, the escort listing at the top of the Escort Targeting Command Window will show the first letter of the assigned option for each destroyer under the "T" column.
	+ In this case, the T column will read
		+ D, S, E, and H

## Escort Bombardment

1. The last option, Bombardment, can only be assigned to an escort that is in orbit with your ship.
2. To illustrate this, close the Targeter window by pressing [Esc], and move away from the planet using manual navigation.
3. Use the Targeter to return to the planet.
4. This time, instruct your escorts to orbit with you (you can do this more quickly using one of the escord Commands - see below).
5. When all the escorts arrive in orbit, set them to Bombardment targeting mode and watch them fire a few salvos.
6. Go to the War Map
	+ Target a system containing a starfort.
	+ Do not target the starfort itself.
	+ Target some place on the other side of the system.
	+ Leave orbit. Go to the target system.

## Escort Commands
1. The third option on the escort command line is **Commands**.
2. Commands are given the same way as targeting options are assigned.
3. Use the cursor keys, the [+] and [-] keys, and [ENTER].
4. The Data command shows the scort information table illustrated on page 70 of the **Battle Manual**.
	+ (If you assign this command to ALL escorts, pressing any key moves the display from one escort to the next.)

### Move towards Starfort
1. Set a manual course for the starfort 
2. Slowing move towards the starfort, so you have time to experiment with commands
	+ Perhaps set a speed of 0.2

### Release Command
1. The Release command is used to release an escort from his duties and let him go his own way as an independent destroyer.
		+ Use this command on Escort #1
1. Go to the Main Display 
2. Watch the escort leave station
	+ Don't let him get out of TAC range
	+ If necessary press [ALT + F] to freeze simulation.
## Swap Command
1.  Next, return to the Commands box and use the Swap command.
	+ Designate that you want to swap Escorts #1 and #2.
		+ There is presently no Escort #1 
		+ Watch as Escort #2 now moves to the station previously occupied by Escort #1.
		+ The #2 slot is now vacant.
## Conscript Command
1. Be sure the previously released escort is in TAC
2. You do not have to select an escort number.
	+ Move the targeting box over the released destroyer.
	+ The destroyer is not as bright as your current escorts.
	+ Press [ENTER]
3. A message acknowledgement appears at the bottom of the command window
	+ Press [ESC] and you will get the message "Escort Conscripted".
4. Return to the Main Display
5. The newly conscripted escort will turn bright green again and move to the station.
### Why Conscript Can Fail
1. There is a chance that, between the time you release the escort and the time you try to conscript it again, Fleet HQ will assume other duties.
	+ If Fleet HQ has re-asigned the ship, your **Conscript Command** will be refused.
	+ In this case, you would be left with only three escorts.
	+ If you want to get back to four escorts, you will have to find a destroyer willing to join you.
## Rendezvous command 

1. The **Rendezvous command* simply brings the escort close to your ship,.
2. This is the command you could have used to bring all four escorts into orbit before using the Bombardment targeting option.
3. Try the **Redezvous command** now on all four escorts and watch them cluster around your ship.
4. When the ships are close to you, you can resupply them using your teleporters.

## Go to Station command
1. The **Go to Station** command orders the selected escort to stop whatever they are doing and go to their proper station.
2. **Go to Station** will cancel a **Rendezvous command**
3. **Go to Station** is useful when your escorts are:
	+ Wandering around aimlessly 
	+ Flouting your orders
